# minecraft-added-files-manager

This is a practise project in which I'm planning on adding more functions in the future and makeing it easier to use.
This console app main purpose is to make adding mods, texturepasks, shaderpasks easier for a players.

instruction:
Because of my lack of knowledge and practise this works by chooing what kind of file you wand to move then entering full file name (I mean FULL filename) that is located in user Downloads folder.
